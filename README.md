## Code Challenge at Younoodle.

YouNoodle's flagship product helps startup programs accept applications, as well as having judges to evaluate these applicants and then finally share results.
As part of this flow, an important step is to correctly and efficiently match judges to applicants based on their data and preferences in a given startup program.

Our coding assignment revolves around the same logic - matching investors to startups based on a set of data that we've also shared with you (please see the attached file).
